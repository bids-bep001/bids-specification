| VFA     | flip                      | Variable flip angle                        | The VFA method involves at least two spoiled gradient echo (SPGR) of steady-state free precession (SSFP) images acquired at different flip angles. Depending on the provided metadata fields and the sequence type, data may be eligible for DESPOT1, DESPOT2 and their variants ([Deoni et al. 2005](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mrm.20314)).

The MTS method involves three sets of anatomical images that differ in terms of application of a magnetization transfer RF pulse (MTon or MToff) and flip angle ([Helms et al. 2008](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mrm.21732)).                                                                                                               |
